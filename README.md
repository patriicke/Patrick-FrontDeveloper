This is the SpaceX assignment in React and Php in connecting the SpaceX API and this application.

# This is the guide of the SpaceX
This is the guide to use the SpaceX clone on your device.

**1**. Since we are using **PHP** to connect our **SpaceX** clone and **SpaceX** backend we are including **laravel**, so you must have **composer**.

**2**. So now if you have it installed you can run **npm install** and **composer install** to install packages on your device.

**3**. After installing you are now able to use the application by simply running these commands. **npm run dev** and **npm run php** and go to this link **localhost:8000** to run the application in browser.

**Here is attached the video of the frontend of SpaceX clone simply click on it.**
